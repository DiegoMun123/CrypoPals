# CrypoPals
Cryptopals challenges. Sets 1, 2 and 3. Probably not all of them. 
Right now only the first challenge from the first set is uploaded. I will upload the rest in the near future. 
I use cmake and gtest for building and testing the proyect. You need to clone the google test repository. 

Build and test: 

git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

ctest
